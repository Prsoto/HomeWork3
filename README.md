This Week we are required to deliver a HomeWork which we create a PassWord Generator

For the HTML I have Used 

## Goal 

  The idea is to consolidate the knowledge of the third week of classes as we move forward to JS world.
  
  It requires to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write( HTML and CSS are granted for this assigment). It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
